This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First install the app:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install 


Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Comnmit rules

*NEVER* push directly to the ```main``` branch. Instead, we will have the practice of creating a new branch for each major feature we will be working on. Example:

```mms-layout-setup```- this is the branch I used to set up the grid and major layout structure. When creating a new branch use this structure:
Your initials + your feature like: ```mms-header-component``` - after you finish your work, open a PR to the ```development``` branch. Here's the documentation on how to open PRs: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests

Then I will check the code, approve or add comments, and then we can move to the dev branch - on which we will have the preview setup. Only when all is approved on the preview, we will move to the ```main``` branch which will be the production environment.
